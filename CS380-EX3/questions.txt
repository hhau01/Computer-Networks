try 
$ ./sniffex eth13

doesn't work because we do not have admin privilege


when we change filter_exp[] = "tcp"

sniffer doesn't catch anything because packets are in ICMP not TCP



wireshark

while wireshark was running on vm1, vm2 connected using telnet

wireshark then began capturing all the keystrokes from vm2

and when right click and select "Follow TCP stream" it shows you

everything that was on the vm2's terminal which was frightening

it speaks for itself the security of using telnet as a method of

remotely using a system



for the second test, we used ssh(Secure SHell) which also allows

remote login to a system. when we connect, wireshark begins capturing

all the packets; however, this time all the packets are encrypted.

when we select "Follow TCP stream", instead of showing what was exactly

in vm2's terminal, it showed the names of the different cryptographic 

algorithms used (diffie hellman, rsa, etc) and it also showed the

encrypted data symbols. the security of ssh was leaps and bounds

ahead of telnet. i do not know why anybody would use telnet.
